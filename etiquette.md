## **ETIQUETTE** 

... *for coding, repo structure and file naming, etc.* adapted from the [EdDataScienceEES](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/DataScienceHub2020/blob/master/etiquette.md) course repo etiquette page

COURSE: Data Science in Ecology and Environmental Science, *University of Edinburgh*

> Please read and familiarize yourself with the **etiquette** before you begin using this repository to implement changes, etc. 

<br/> 

1. Create sections and group code thematically <br/>
Create outline by adding `----` after the heading 

<br/> 

2. Include the following to provide sufficient information to the script 
    + Title, Name, Date, Contact details (*e.g.* email)
    + Package title and its brief description 

<br/> 

3. Comment on your code using `#` so that everyone can follow and understand the code and the workflow 

<br/> 

4. Be sure to include consistent spacing 
    + Spaces around logical operators (*e.g.*, `<-`, `=`, `==`, etc.)
    + Spaces after commas 
    + Inline commenting; add `# comment text` two spaces after the code 

<br/>

5. Naming etiquette in files, objects, functions, etc. 
    + **Files** / **Folders**; avoid using spaces and instead use underscores `_`
    + **Objects**; use underscores `_` and lowercase characters 
    + **Functions**; use periods `.` and verbs with lowercase characters
    + **Variables**; recommended to use nouns

<br/>

6. Remember to indent code (after commas, logical operator, etc.) and avoid having a long code on one line <br/>
(i.e., limit to 80-100 characters per line)
    + When using **pipes** (`%>%`) from the dplyr package; keep the pipe operator at the end of the line and continue the pipe on a new line 
    + When using **ggplot2**; keep the `+` at the end of the line and continue adding on layers on a new line 

<br/> 

7. Use relative filepaths (i.e., short and sensible) to produce a reproducible script 

<br/>

8. Remember to `commit`, `pull`, `push` with an informative commit messages along with the subsequent changes (*e.g.* Seina added the etiquette file)

<br/> 

9. If there is a code conflict; do NOT `push` until you have decided together with the person you are in conflict with which version to keep 

<br/> 

10. When asking a QUESTION; remember to include error message, your goal, the solutions you have tried and why they did not work out 
    + When ANSWERING a question; remember to give an example that's as reproducible as possible <br/> 
    *e.g.* If your solution requires additional package, mention them

<br/>

## BE CONCISE, CONSISTENT, AND INFORMATIVE
